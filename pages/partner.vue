                                For MagicSchool users on the free platform, limits will change dynamically based on overall
                                usage to ensure smooth access for our premium users. The calculation we use intends for the
                                majority of users not to hit a generation limit until nearing the end of the month and power
                                users to be limited sooner. Limits will reset monthly and users will get a warning as
                                they‚Äôre getting close to their limit.
