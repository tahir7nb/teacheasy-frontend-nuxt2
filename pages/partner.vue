                                For MagicSchool users on the free platform, limits will change dynamically based on overall
                                usage to ensure smooth access for our premium users. The calculation we use intends for the
                                majority of users not to hit a generation limit until nearing the end of the month and power
                                users to be limited sooner. Limits will reset monthly and users will get a warning as
                                they’re getting close to their limit.

                            </p>
                            <p>For MagicSchool Plus and MagicSchool Enterprise users, you will have unlimited* access.</p>
                            <p>‍*Only the top .1% of users will be capped to prevent account sharing and other extreme

                            <p>
                                Since usage limits change dynamically based on total platform usage, we’re not able to share
                                that with you precisely (but you will get a warning when you're getting close as described
                                above). If you love MagicSchool, let your school administration know so they can join the AI
                                Innovators Program or if your school isn’t ready, subscribe to MagicSchool Plus.
